# PLUGS Mobile App

The PLUGS Mobile Application is an Android application written in Java with Android Studio. Currently we are targetting a minimum SDK version of 16 (Android 4.1). 

_note:_ The current version has a number of settings and things you can enable/disable.  It would be expected that the version that is fielded would simply startup in the proper configuration

## Primary Features

* Configurable Server Connection
* Configurable Device Id - Unique ID for this device, must be registered on the base station
* Configurable Target Device Ids - List of other Unique Device IDs that should be triggered to capture media
* _future version:_ configurable settings for motion detection thresholds
